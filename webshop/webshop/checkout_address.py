"""Server-side contract for the checkout address form.

PR-Foundry fork addition (checkout address form design, 2026-09-24).

Registered through ``override_whitelisted_methods`` rather than by editing
``shopping_cart/cart.py``. webshop is an upstream fork here, so every line changed in a file
upstream owns is a line a sync can reset and a re-verify grep has to watch. The override
mechanism is the same one ``za_courier_guy`` uses to withdraw its shipping rule, and it keeps
the patch surface in upstream-owned files at zero.

Deliberately a top-level module and not ``webshop/webshop/api/…``: upstream ships
``webshop/webshop/api.py``, and a package beside it hides the module (see ``maps.py``).
