"""Portal "Pay" endpoint for logged-in webshop customers and suppliers.

PR-Foundry/framework#182 (fork marker).

ERPNext's ``make_payment_request`` gates on **two** doctype permissions, in this order::

    frappe.has_permission("Payment Request", "create", throw=True)  # doctype-INDEPENDENT
    frappe.has_permission(args.dt, "read", args.dn, throw=True)  # per reference doctype

A real portal user's roles are ``['All', 'Customer', 'Guest']`` (``Portal Settings.default_role``
is ``Customer``), and erpnext ships **no** permission row granting ``Customer`` anything on
Payment Request, Sales Invoice or Sales Order. ``frappe.has_permission`` consults role, user and
share permissions only -- never website permission -- so **both** gates fail, for **every**
reference doctype. The native order-page "Pay" link therefore 403s for exactly the customers the
on-account flow exists to serve.

What a portal user *does* hold is ``has_website_permission`` on their own document, backed by a
``Portal User`` row on their Customer (``erpnext.controllers.website_list_for_contact``). This
module gates on that -- the permission they actually have -- and only then elevates so
``make_payment_request``'s own doctype checks pass. The ownership gate always runs *before* any
elevation, so a user can never pay another party's document.

Why this lives in **webshop** and not in a client app: webshop owns the template that calls it and
is forked by every sibling from PR-Foundry, so siblings inherit one implementation. The previous
per-tier wrappers (``client_app.api.portal.pay_invoice`` here,
``client_app.api.guest_checkout.pay_for_order`` at OA-Method) each lived in a *client-specific*
app, which is precisely why the shared template diverged and why a sibling could not resolve the
function the template named.

Known, unclosed: framework#109 -- this endpoint is state-changing but reachable via GET, mirroring
the native ``make_payment_request`` GET pattern.

	``make_payment_request`` uses to set the Payment Request's ``grand_total``. Asking the
	*charging* function whether there is anything to charge is what keeps the affordance and
	the charge from drifting apart: the button is offered exactly when a non-zero amount would
	be requested.

	It also removes the per-doctype hand-rolled conditions this bug came from. ``get_amount``
	already handles both shapes, currency conversion included:

	* Sales/Purchase Order -- ``(rounded_total or grand_total) - flt(advance_paid)``; ``flt``
	  maps a ``None`` ``advance_paid`` (its value before any payment) to ``0.0``.
	* Sales/Purchase Invoice -- driven by ``outstanding_amount``.

	Fails **closed** (returns ``0.0``) if erpnext cannot value the document. A hidden Pay button
