"""A seam for shipping apps to say where a parcel is (PR-Foundry/framework#229).

PR-Foundry fork addition. Upstream webshop has no file of this name, so it cannot conflict
on a sync.

A portal order page shows the order and its attachments and stops there. A shipping app has
nowhere to tell the customer where their parcel is, and webshop's order template is
upstream-owned — so without a seam, each shipping app's only route is to fork that template
and watch it diverge on the next sync. One app doing that is a maintenance cost; three doing
it is three incompatible forks of the same file.

**The contract.** An app registers a dotted path and returns structured data:

    # any shipping app's hooks.py
    webshop_shipping_panels = ["za_courier_guy.portal.collection.panel"]

    def panel(doctype: str, name: str) -> dict | None:
        '''None when this app has nothing to say about this document.'''
        return {"title": ..., "status": ..., "rows": [{"label": ..., "value": ...}]}

**Data, never markup.** Contributors return labels and values; the bundle renders them with
``textContent``. An app returning HTML would make every other app's panel an XSS surface on
a public storefront — and "it's a trusted app" is not a boundary, because a carrier's
tracking string is attacker-influenced data arriving *through* that app.
